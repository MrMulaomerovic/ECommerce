# ECommerce
## Prvi veliki projekat

_Titles and internal titles_ - The ECommerc back-end project is a small part of what needs to be done to create an online shop and the first large project in a series, which was realized with the help of my mentor Mahmić Šahzudin. ECommerc was developed as a final project and assignment at Spark School, and I hope it will come in handy for someone as a starting point for learning.

_Introduction_- the project's aim - Since this is my first big project, working within Spark School, I don't expect anything special from him except that he gave me extra wind in my back to work even harder and harder to develop as a back-end programmer, who knows maybe as a full-stack programmer. I also hope that what I have done will be enough for the Spark School certificate.


_Technologies_ - The technologies used are Node.js with express framework, while I used MongoDB to communicate with the database, and GitHub repositories to share the project with others.
